# KNN-Linear-Regression-Prophet-for-Stock-Price-Prediction
KNN + Linear Regression + Prophet Prediction for Stocks, and Prophet base seasonal trend analysis. 
I developed this tool mainly to gain more experience in time series analysis and object-oriented programming. I will occasionally update this project by adding more fuctions. Please do not use it for making any investment or trading decision.
